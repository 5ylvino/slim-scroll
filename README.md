Ultimate-slim-scroll 
====================

Ultimate slim scroll is a replacement of default scrollbar provided by browsers. 
This plugin lets you design the scroll bar by using simple css properties. It is created using vanilla javascript and css.

To make it work, include `us-scroll.js` (_plugin_) and `us-scroll.css` files in your project.

###How to use:

    <script>
        window.onload = function(){  
            var element = document.getElementsByClassName('contentHolder')[0];

            // Apply slim scroll plugin
            scrollBar.useSlimScroll(element);
        }
    </script>

_need to refactor the code, which I will do soon_

Please file issues if you find any.
