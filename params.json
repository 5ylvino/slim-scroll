{"name":"Slim-scroll","tagline":"HTML element scroll bar as replacement for default browser's scroll-bar. Design as you want using CSS.","body":"#Slim-scroll (_JavaScript Scroll Plugin_)\r\n\r\n\r\nSlim scroll is a replacement of default scrollbar provided by browsers. This plugin lets you design the scroll-bar by using simple css properties. It is created using javascript and css.\r\n\r\n[Download](https://github.com/venkateshwar/slim-scroll/releases/latest)&nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp;[Github](https://github.com/venkateshwar/slim-scroll/)\r\n\r\n**Tested on**: IE9+, Chrome and Firefox.\r\n\r\n##[Demo](https://rawgit.com/venkateshwar/slim-scroll/master/index.html)\r\n\r\n###How to use:\r\n- To make it work, include `slimscroll.js` (_plugin_) in `head` tag.\r\n- Apply height to the container in fixed units or percentage.\r\n- Just design the scrollbar as you want by applying css classes as explained below.\r\n- [In IE8] Apply high specificity to override normal styles given to the scroll bar.\r\n\r\nand then:\r\n\r\n#####Method 1 (_with no added styles_):\r\n\r\n    new slimScroll(Element);   // 'Element' is Javascript DOM object\r\n\r\n#####Method 2 (_with added styles_):\r\n\r\nor to add your own defined css styles:\r\n\r\n    new slimScroll(Element, {\r\n      'wrapperClass': '',\r\n\r\n      'scrollBarClass': '',\r\n\r\n      'scrollBarContainerClass': '',  \r\n\r\n      'scrollBarContainerSpecialClass': '',\r\n\r\n      'scrollBarMinHeight': '',\r\n\r\n      'scrollBarFixedHeight': '',\r\n\r\n      'keepFocus': true/false\r\n    });\r\n\r\n###Explanation of above properties:\r\n\r\n- **wrapperClass** (*type - \"string\"*) : Mention wrapper class here.\r\n- **scrollBarClass** (*type - \"string\"*) : Mention scroll bar class here.\r\n- **scrollBarContainerClass** (*type - \"string\"*) : Mention scroll bar container class here.\r\n- **scrollBarContainerSpecialClass** (*type - \"string\"*) : This property is used to mention a class which will be applied only when the user is scrolling the content. Could be helpful while applying animations to the scroll bar.\r\n- **scrollBarMinHeight** (*type - \"Integer\"*) : Used to mention minimum scroll bar height here (without pixel unit)\r\n- **scrollBarFixedHeight** (*type - \"Integer\"*) : Used to mention scroll bar fixed height (without pixel unit). This makes sure to show the scroll bar height fixed even when content inside the container is increased.\r\n- **keepFocus** (*type - \"Boolean\"*) : Used to focus the container.\r\n\r\n###To make this work on height resize:\r\n\r\n    var customScroll = new slimScroll();\r\n    window.onresize = customScroll.resetValues;  // pure javascript example.\r\n\r\n###Note:\r\n\r\n- Usage of the above mentioned properties is optional or as per need.\r\n- Add [higher specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) css to override the custom styles which are being applied by the plugin.\r\n- Don't override the styles which are given highest specificity (`!important`) by the plugin (_those styles are necessary to make this scroll plugin work_).\r\n\r\n\r\n###How I got this thought:\r\n\r\nI got this thought, when I found solution to hide the default scrollbar (_using css_) which was the requirement for a post on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16671476/1577396).\r\n\r\nThe solution was simple but that is how I got this thought :).\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you find any issue(s), please file [here](https://github.com/venkateshwar/slim-scroll/issues).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
